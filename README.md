This project demonstrates the implementation of **K-Means Clustering** in Python, including data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of clusters using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing using Pandas
- K-Means clustering with Scikit-learn
- Visualization of clusters and centroids
- Evaluation using inertia and other metrics
